# AntiVPN Plugin

## Description

The AntiVPN plugin for Minecraft detects players using a VPN upon their connection to the server. It logs the information in a YAML file for easy management and provides a command to check the VPN status of players.
(for now, its in devellopement, so its only about manual detection)


## Upcoming Improvements

1. **Enhanced VPN Detection**: Improving the accuracy of VPN detection, because sometimes it doesnt recognise a VPN
2. **Kick VPN Users**: Add functionality to kick players using a VPN when trying to connect
3. **API Key Management**: Revise API key handling for better security and flexibility (use it if you want, i dont pay anything)
